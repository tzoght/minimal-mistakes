excerpt: What What Angel investors want to know before investing in your startup

---

Angel investors invest in early-stage startup companies in exchange for a stake in the company and understand that startups have a high risk of failure. Ultimately, an angel investor needs to feel confident that the potential upside/rewards from investing are worth the downside risks. What are the essential items angel investors analyze in deciding whether or not to invest in a startup?
* Is there a great founder/management team?
* Is the market opportunity big?
* What positive early traction has the company achieved?
* Are the founders passionate, determined, and in it for the long haul?
* Do the founders understand the financials and key metrics of their business?
* Does the investor know the entrepreneur? If not, has the entrepreneur been referred by a trusted colleague?
* Is the initial investor pitch deck professional and exciting?
* What are the potential risks to the business?
* Why is the company’s product great?
* How will the investment capital be used, and what progress will be made with 
that capital?
* Does the company have differentiated technology?
* Are the company’s financial projections believable and interesting?
* How will the company market its products or services?
* What are the specific terms and valuation of the financing round?
