Burnout is the combination of three emotions: exhaustion, negativity and ineffectiveness. The feelings of negativity and ineffectiveness are what differentiate it from regular tiredness or exhaustion. And it’s different from depression in that it’s purely work-related — you don’t burn out from relationship issues or life stressors

Root causes:

* Their goals and targets feel genuinely unachievable
* Their goalposts for success keep moving
* They don’t have enough autonomy
* They don’t feel like they’re mastering new skills
* Rewards, recognition and workload feel unevenly distributed
* The work culture feels competitive or unsupportive
* Their job requirements don’t fit with their personality and strengths
* Their job requirements don’t fit with their values and dreams

Burnout first aid: time off

* Make it okay to flag when people feel overstretched
* Praise under-promising and over-delivering
* Encourage people to be clearer about their boundaries
* Build holiday time into execution plans
* Protect your team’s time — for example, let them periodically turn off Slack notifications or try ‘Deep Work Wednesdays’
