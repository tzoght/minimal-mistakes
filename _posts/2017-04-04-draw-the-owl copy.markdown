I first watched this [YouTube Add](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwSe2imUyvg), four years ago. I occasionally mention it, in passing conversations, and I get two types of reactions:

* Are you kidding me ? Not my cup of tea, I don't buy this
* This is cool, I am in love with the idea ...

I usually wait for the audience's reaction before I give my 2 cents, and sometimes I don't bother giving my opinion for the fear of sounding like Anthony Robins :-)

Well, here's what I believe:
1. You must aim to hire people that are humbler(more humble), hungrier and smarter than you (in that particular order)
2. Above all, you have to make it clear that __you__ don't know all the answers __yet__, but you have the hunger and the resolve to get things done and master the required skills
3. And, you expect them to do the same :-)

If [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) managed to build and maintain a vibrant community of designers who can draw the f***ing owl in this community, then the future is bright for this city and this country.
