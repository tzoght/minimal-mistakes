<p>
  Hello, my name is Tony Zoght and I have spent a good part of the last 20 years of my life, working on a number of
  software projects, developing, architecting and managing.
</p>

<p>
  I have strong passion for designing software systems based on a simple and elegant architecture that delivers operational simplicity.
</p>

<p>
  I value:
  <ul>
  <li>Infrastructure as code</li>
  <li>Designer experience </li>
  <li>Ierative implementation, but well-thought and sound architecture</li>
  <li>Automating everything</li>
  </ul>
</p>
